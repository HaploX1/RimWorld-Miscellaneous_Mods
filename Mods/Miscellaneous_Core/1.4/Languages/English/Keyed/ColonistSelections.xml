	<ColonistGroups_GameStartHelp_prt2>The keys 6, 7, 8, 9 can be used to define groups and positions.\nUse them like this:\nDraft the colonists you want to define the group or position for and place them at their target positions. Now select who you want in this group, and press SHIFT+6 (for group 1).\nThe positions of your drafted and selected colonists are now saved to this group.\nTo recall the positions just press 6. This can be done for the keys 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\nNote: If the group mode (switch: SHIFT+0) is active, they will only be selected.\nIn this mode they won't go to any saved positions.\n\nThere are two more groups who are not assigned any keys yet. These groups (green icons) can be used to mark/select buildings.</ColonistGroups_GameStartHelp_prt2>
	<ColonistGroups_GameStartHelp_prt3>Key 0 has two functions:\nIf pressed once, your drafted colonists who don't have an active job, will be undrafted.\nSecondly press SHIFT+0 to switch the recall mode (6-9) between POSITION and GROUP.\n\nFurthermor there is BACKSPACE.\nWith BACKSPACE the camera will jump randomly into your homezone.\nThis is a kind of goto-colony-button.\n\nAll key bindings can be changed in the keybinding dialog.</ColonistGroups_GameStartHelp_prt3>
