-Turret: Weapon Base
   You want to build your own turrets? Build or buy an automatic base from a trader and add your weapon of choice to it.
   The manable weapon base needs the research 'Smithing', the automatic version needs 'Gun Turrets'.
-Micro Turret Launcher
   A launcher with nanobots inside the projectile. Will do virtually no damage, but builds a micro turret at its place of impact.
-Nano Replicator
   Like a 3D-Printer only for much more complex items
   Needs to be researched.
